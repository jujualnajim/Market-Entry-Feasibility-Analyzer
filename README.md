# Market-Entry-Feasibility-Analyzer

A Java desktop app that consultants and strategists can use to assess the rationality of entering a new market.

It factors in important details including ease of doing business, political stability, market growth, and country risk and then gives you a score, risk level and clear recommendation.

I made a custom score formula and even included the code to save the output to a text file. The app reads from example data files (countries. txt, industries. txt) of real, actual working values so you can test it out immediately or insert your own.

It's easy, it's quick and it's designed for anyone conducting market entry research.

Made With Java  - No Libraries Or Dependencies Required.
